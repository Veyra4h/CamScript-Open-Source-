# CamScript (Open Sourced)
Made a camera script for roblox games, it sets your camera to top down, also gets rid of jumping.

Your player faces where the cursor is anddd yeah

When copying the script, make it a ***LocalScript*** and put it in ***StarterPlayerScripts.***

Thanks for the support on my first video <3
